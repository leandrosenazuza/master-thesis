\vspace{-35pt}
The accurate identification of equipment in images plays a crucial role in various operations related to energy substations, as it facilitates not only maintenance, but also the monitoring of these facilities. In this work, preliminary results are presented on the efficiency of YOLOv8 in detecting the air core reactor in images obtained by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Different optimization techniques were applied to obtain better detection efficiency. From this study, it will be possible to extend the use of the technique to speed up the process of generating Virtual Environments for Training procedures in an energy substation.
